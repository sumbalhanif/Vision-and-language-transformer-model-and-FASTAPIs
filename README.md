# FASTAPIs
Have worked on this project using FastAPI, where I implemented vision and language transformers model. In this project, both text and image are provided as input. For example, I can give a random image and ask the model any question about the content of the image, and the model provides accurate answers, such as:
Q1:How many dogs are there in the picture? 
A:3 
Q2: What is the color of the flowers? 
A:Red 
Additionally, I have deployed this application using Docker.
